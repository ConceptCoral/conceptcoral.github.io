title: "About ConceptCoral & Founder"
---

I am a biostatistician with 10 years of clinical study experience on drug safety, efficacy, etc.

The idea of 'Concept Coral' is that: the concepts in an research area are correlated and 'grow' and 'interact' with each other.
It's not a simple hierachical relation between each other.
